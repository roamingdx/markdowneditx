## Summary

> This document was written with Markdown Editx

Markdown Editx is a simple, minimalist website designed to provide a distraction-free writing experience. It includes everything you need to write your documents without the clutter and discomfort of too many on-screen options.

This tool was created to address the needs of its developer, who found other platforms and software unsuitable. With Markdown Editx, you can focus solely on writing without any worries, and best of all, it's free.

When you log in, you'll see a small placeholder prompting you to start writing and to select your text to save it. The editor offers flexible formatting options, allowing you to use its markdown syntax or the formatting bar that appears when you highlight text. This ensures you can format your document in the best way possible.
